In Laravel, you can handle asynchronous tasks like sending emails using queues and background jobs.
Here's how you can ensure that the email is sent asynchronously:

1. Configure Queue Driver
First, you need to configure a queue driver in your config/queue.php file. 
Laravel supports several queue drivers like Redis, Amazon SQS, and database. 
For example, to use the database queue driver, you can set it like this:


'default' => env('QUEUE_CONNECTION', 'database'),


2. Create a Job
Next, create a job class that will be responsible for sending the email. 
You can generate a job using the Artisan command:

php artisan make:job SendEmailJob


This will create a new job class app/Jobs/SendEmailJob.php. In this class, you need to 
define the logic for sending the email in the handle method:


<?php

// Define the namespace for the job class
namespace App\Jobs;

// Import necessary classes from the Laravel framework
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable; // Trait for queueable jobs
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue; // Interface for jobs that should be queued
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable; // Base class for creating email messages
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue; // Trait for interacting with the queue
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels; // Trait for serializing job data
use Mail; // Facade for sending emails

// Define the SendEmailJob class that implements the ShouldQueue interface
class SendEmailJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    // Use traits to add functionality to the job class
    use InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    // Property to hold the Mailable instance
    protected $mailable;

    // Constructor to initialize the job with a Mailable instance
    public function __construct(Mailable $mailable)
    {
        $this->mailable = $mailable; // Assign the Mailable instance to the class property
    }

    // Method to handle the job execution
    public function handle()
    {
        // Use the Mail facade to send the email using the provided Mailable instance
        Mail::send($this->mailable);
    }
}
?>


3 Dispatch the Job
After creating the job, you need to dispatch it from the controller or event handler 
where the form is being submitted. You can use the dispatch method provided by Laravel:


use App\Jobs\SendEmailJob;
use App\Mail\YourEmailMailable;

public function handleFormSubmission(Request $request)
{
    // Logic for handling the form submission

    $mailable = new YourEmailMailable($data);
    SendEmailJob::dispatch($mailable);

    // Other logic...
}


Here, YourEmailMailable is the mailable class you have created for the email you want to send.


4. Run the Queue Worker
Finally, you need to start a queue worker to process the jobs from the queue. 
You can run the worker using the Artisan command:


php artisan queue:work


This command will start a worker that listens for new jobs and processes them as they arrive in the queue.
